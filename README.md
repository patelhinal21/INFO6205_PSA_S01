implemented and coded the following algorithms in Java:

- Parallel sorting algorithms:
Implemented a parallel sorting algorithm to sort array partitions in parallel, experimenting with different cutoff values and thread counts.
Algorithms included merge sort, quicksort, heapsort.

-3SUM algorithms:
Implemented quadratic and quadratic with calipers solutions for the 3SUM problem. Compared performance with cubic solution.

-Insertion sort:
Implemented insertion sort and analyzed its performance on different initial orderings of the input array (random, ordered, partially ordered, reverse ordered).

-Union-find/Disjoint set data structure:
Implemented height weighted quick union with path compression. Experimented with number of connections generated as number of elements scales.

-Benchmarking/analysis of sorting algorithms:
Used instrumentation to analyze metrics like comparisons, swaps, copies, etc. for sorting algorithms like merge sort, quicksort, heapsort. 
Analyzed which metrics best predict overall execution time.

-Timer class:
Implemented repeat(), getClock() and toMillisecs() methods for a Timer class used in benchmarking.
